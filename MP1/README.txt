Description:
In this program, a canvas is created using a 2D array in the method CreateCanvas. Through main, characters are added onto the canvas by calling the addCharacter method and then outputting the final "painting" in the printCanvas method. Note, that you are able to easily make this with user input as the code is created for any # of rows and # of columns.

Output: 
4 + = = = = = = = = + 
3 |                 | 
2 |       < 3       | 
1 |                 | 
0 + = = = = = = = = + 
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
